## Design Executive Summary:
- Our group used Vue.js and Firebase to create an interactive learning website on the topic of music from three different perspectives:
    - Music Experiment (note identification, etc)
    - Classical Piano Quiz (music history knowledge, etc)
    - Music and Emotion (how different music would affect emotions differently)
- Our main feature is to experiment with audios on Vue and Firebase including writing and reading the data. 
- The users are music learners who can explore and experience different learning aspects on our website to start a unique, fun, and engaging learning journey.
